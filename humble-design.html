        <p>Imagine going from nothing to having a furnished home! Humble Design furnishes houses top to bottom for homeless in shelters going into housing and veterans. They provide everything to make a house a home from donations! Less than 1% return to homelessness. They give all children a plaque with their name on it in their own room to give them a sense of belonging.</p>
        <h3>What we do</h3>
        <p>Work in their warehouse to check, clean and put away donated goods. Paint plaques for kids so that all children may have a plaque with their name on it. It is theirs alone. Do a home deco, going into a new space decorating it for them with Humble Designs goods.</p>
