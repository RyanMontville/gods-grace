        <h1>Trials for Hope</h1>
        <h2>Helping people who are under the bridges and fall through the cracks</h2>
        <p>Trials for Hope was named by the founder Jonathan Gray who was in a soup kitchen and given a bag of trial size personal items to give out. He gave them out and they gave him more. Those were the first trials for hope.</p>
        <p>They feed people in camps & under bridges and provide food, hygiene supplies, tents, clothes, showers, toilets and dignity. They give food to the homebound having not enough money for food/medicine/heat. Trials for Hope picks up food from grocery stores & the Food Bank providing free fresh produce.</p>
        <p>Community meals are also served.</p>
        <h3>What we do:</h3>
        <p>Make & deliver sleeping mats, pack food and toiletries for the homeless. Sort donations. Serve at a community meal the 2nd Tuesday or 4th Monday of the month 3:30-6 PM. Sponsor a fundraiser.</p>
